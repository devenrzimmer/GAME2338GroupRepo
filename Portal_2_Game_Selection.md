Summary
Portal 2 is the result of everything learned in it's predecessor, compiled with some of the best puzzle makers and level designers available, it's clear that functionality was a prioritized factor in the game. Not to mention the difficultyraising as you progress into the game at a fair pace. It's a game that slowly builds up your confidence in your puzzle skills and helps refine them the entire way through even with the addition of new gameplay elements in some parts you're already ready for whatever the game throws at you by that point. The coop is a big bonus for the game too, once you've finished the main story which in itself is amazing, the cooperative story is even more puzzles with the added difficulty of coordinating with your team and the teamwork aspect at the same time. This places the team in a position where they have even more to handle since the game developers were able to work with teamwork in mind.
